The files in this directory are patches against ncurses 5.7 release.

Patches are named according to the date on which I generate them, e.g.,

	ncurses-5.7-yyyymmdd.patch.gz
	
I usually upload a new patch file on Saturday evenings.  If a serious error
is found, I will make a patch that resolves that problem.

Roughly once a month I create a rollup patch, which consists of all changes
from the release through the current date.  If you have the rollup patch, you
will not need the corresponding weekly patch -- it's included.

Rollup patches are a shell script, e.g.,

	patch-5.7-yyyymmdd.sh.gz

Once I have uploaded a rollup patch, I remove older weekly patches.  The weekly
patches are of interest mainly to people who are mirroring development trees
with ncurses.
