Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated
context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for that
grammar. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop
a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple desk
calculators to complex programming languages.
