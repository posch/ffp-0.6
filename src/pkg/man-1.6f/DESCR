* man is a man pager. It has support for compressed
  pages (both man pages and cat pages), and for locale
  ($LANG) and for message catalogs ($LC_MESSAGES). It
  will format files given explicitly (man ./foo.man.gz).
  It conforms to FSSTND or FHS, and handles stray cats.
* man2html is a utility that converts man pages to html
* hman is a man browser that uses your favorite browser.
  For use with lynx, no http daemon is required.
