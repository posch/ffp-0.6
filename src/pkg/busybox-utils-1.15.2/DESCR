BusyBox: The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
single small executable.

This package includes networking programs (arp, brctl, ifconfig,
rdate, ...), the busybox ash shell, and various system utilities
(adjtimex, killall5, last, time, ...).
