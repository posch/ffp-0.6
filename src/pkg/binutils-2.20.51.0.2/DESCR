The GNU Binutils are a collection of binary tools. The main ones are:
 * ld - the GNU linker.
 * as - the GNU assembler.

The binutils have been ported to most major Unix variants as well as
Wintel systems, and their main reason for existence is to give the GNU
system (and GNU/Linux) the facility to compile and link programs.
