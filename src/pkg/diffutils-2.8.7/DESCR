You can use the diff command to show differences between two files, or
each corresponding file in two directories. diff outputs differences
between files line by line in any of several formats, selectable by
command line options. This set of differences is often called a `diff'
or `patch'. For files that are identical, diff normally produces no
output; for binary (non-text) files, diff normally reports only that
they are different.
