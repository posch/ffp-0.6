The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been
supported by the INRIA and the current main authors come from the
CACAO and Arénaire project-teams at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP
(Lyon, France) respectively; see more on the credit page. MPFR is
based on the GMP multiple-precision library.
