The GNU `gettext' utilities are a set of tools that provides a
framework to help other GNU packages produce multi-lingual
messages. These tools include a set of conventions about how programs
should be written to support message catalogs, a directory and file
naming organization for the message catalogs themselves, a runtime
library supporting the retrieval of translated messages, and a few
stand-alone programs to massage in various ways the sets of
translatable strings, or already translated strings.
