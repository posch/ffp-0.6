Which is a utility that prints out the full path of the executables
that bash(1) would execute when the passed program names would have
been entered on the shell prompt. It does this by using the exact same
algorithm as bash.  Tildes and a dot in the PATH are now expanded to
the full path by default.  Options allow to rather print "~/*" or
"./*" and/or to print all exectuables that match any directory in
PATH.
